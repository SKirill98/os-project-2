Example of how to run the project:

Generative AI used: non

Reason for not using AI: For this project, I chose not to utilize generative AI, as I am already proficient in the Git version control process on Linux. I have refreshed my knowledge of relevant Linux commands, enabling me to work confidently within a native Linux environment. By starting the project a week prior to the deadline, I am able to dedicate more time to independent research. Completing the project without generative AI allows me to deepen my understanding and retain new concepts through hands-on implementation.
